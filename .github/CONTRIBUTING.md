# Contributing to Symphony

This is a TL;DR version of the [complete contribution guide](../.docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The two most important things are [comments](../.docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#commenting) and [code style](../.docs/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style).

Please insure that any new method is properly documented and that the code style is respected.

Also, fix any problems found in the CI runs.

Thanks!

- The Symphony Team
